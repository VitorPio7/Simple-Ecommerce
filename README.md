## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Product Catalog:** Browse a grid of available clothing products fetched from a local data source.
-   **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** Add products to the cart from the product list.
-   **State Management with Context API:** Global state for the shopping cart is managed efficiently with `useContext`, avoiding prop drilling.
-   **Update & Remove Items:** Easily increase, decrease, or completely remove items from the cart.
-   **Live Cart Totals:** The total price is calculated and updated in real-time as the cart changes.
-   **Responsive Design:** The UI, styled with `styled-components`, is fully responsive and looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
-   **Client-Side Routing:** Uses `react-router-dom` to navigate between the main store and the cart page without page reloads.

## üéØ Core Concepts Demonstrated

This project serves as a practical demonstration of several key front-end development concepts:

-   **State Management:** Centralized state logic for the shopping cart using **React's Context API** and the **`useReducer` hook** for predictable state transitions.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is broken down into reusable and logical components (Header, ProductCard, CartItem, etc.).
-   **CSS-in-JS:** Styling is encapsulated at the component level using **`styled-components`**, providing scoped styles and enabling dynamic styling based on props.
-   **Hooks:** Extensive use of React Hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and `useEffect` to manage component state and side effects.
-   **Data Flow:** Clear and unidirectional data flow, a core principle of React.
